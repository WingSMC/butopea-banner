# Developer notes

- Couldn't figure out the exact font but Arial was close enough.
- Made a little :hover and :focus effect for the CTA button.
- The previously mentioned button effect (made with ::after) is bugged in Chromium based browsers because the 100% width is actually 100% - 2px still managed to find a workaround.
- Took the liberty to make the `mode` prop optional with the default value of `square`.
